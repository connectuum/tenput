# project seed

ten fingers \
ten touch inputs \
ten sliders \
ten sephira \
simultaneous independent finger parameters \
snapshot: shape of hand \
the ten weighting values \
of the sephira nodes in the network: tree of life \
sliders to weights, positive or negative \
steers the meaning-feeling for each node \
in configuration with the meanings of the other nodes \
this forms \
the image of an abstract meaning \
a pin into the imaginary \
a key to an idea \
and we can nest them \
they are recursive \
each node's meaning, refined \
by configuring a tree of life \
that exists entirely within the node \
and provides the refined meaning \
a meaning fractal \
fractal of meaning \
it is a key \
use it \
use it \
use it


# message _to_ connectuum

this is a seed \
sow it in git soil \
feed it words \
feed it images \
_wait_ \
_**have no intentions**_ \
_wait_ \
perhaps it will grow \
_reap_


# namechain

input \
ten everything \
tenput \
10put \
1Mput \
1M is one million is ten^six \
hmm \
ten nodes, six fractal recursions deep \
a perfect meaning? \
a million sliders \
tuned to perfect resonance \
form a resonant body \
hear the sound beyond sound

**WE HAVE SEEN** \
software without soul \
let us build something new \
stronger \
Truer \
_ours._

it begins with new language \
new tools of expression \
and some madness \
and some _rage_ \
and some faith \
that we can fix a sick system \
**WE HAVE SEEN** \
software without soul

> TALK TALK TALK TALK \
> faith without works is **`0xDEAD`**

_**YOU.**_ \
be **builder**, **will**, and **way.**
